    <tr><td>Sail Soda</td><td>This energy drink, slash soda, is as original as it gets. Like sailing? Then you'll probably enjoy this beverage as well.
            Made for everyone at sea, by things from the sea! Scallops and cod, were in other words part of the production process.
        </td>
    <td><img src="../grafikk/prod/sailthumb.png" alt="sail"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Flattery</td><td>Despite our series of energy drinks being new, this specific drink was one of our major breakthroughs a while back.
            Had it not been for this highly potent drink, our business might not have had such success! Flattery contains about fourteen times as much
            berries as your average can of Battery&copy; - which is exactly why it's so different!
        </td>
    <td><img src="../grafikk/prod/flatthumb.png" alt="flat"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Clut</td><td>Forged out of rainwater, combined with sugar and with a hint of soy sauce - we present the Clut&copy; drink.
            Only to be consumed when your spirits are truly weak, and you know for sure your heart is not susceptible for an attack. Tastes great!
        </td>
    <td><img src="../grafikk/prod/clutthumb.png" alt="clut"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Crazy Bull</td><td>Another invention of ours, the (very) Crazy Bull&copy; energy drink! We pretty much just bought a bunch of
            Red Bull, added more sugar - and made a profit (???).
        </td>
    <td><img src="../grafikk/prod/crazythumb.png" alt="crazy"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Pink Dog</td><td>Also known as 'Not a Dog', this very energy drink can keep an entire family of twelve awake for as long as a whole day.
            One small taste will actually kill you if you're old and weak. Tastes perfect!
